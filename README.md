#										Title : A BALL IN THE BOX
										
# 		Abstract

Computer graphics is responsible for displaying art and image data effectively and meaningfully to the user. This project aims to implement graphics concepts using OpenGL and glut.

In this project we have simulated a 3-D spherical Ball in a Box bouncing off the walls of box. The collisions between the wall and ball are perfectly elastic and there is no influence of gravity i.e. the box is in free space


#      Module

A spherical ball with some initial color, will hit the walls of the box.
The ball will undergo some random color changes.
The box will be 3-dimentional.
The user can the view of the box to fully enjoy the simulation.
The ideal laws of physics will be strictly followed.
